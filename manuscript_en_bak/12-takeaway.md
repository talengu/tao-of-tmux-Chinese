# Takeaway {#takeaway}

In this book, we've taken an organized approach to understanding tmux. As you
use tmux more and more, continue to come back and use this resource to help wrap
your brain around concepts. You do not have to understand the intricacies of
tmux, let alone the terminal, in a single sitting. Acclimation happens over
time.

tmux's userbase varies in skill level. Some readers of this book may have just
learned how to use the `Prefix` key yesterday. Others are looking to tweak their
configurations and host it in their "dot files" on github. There also exists a
very clever hacker who utilizes the advanced scripting capabilities tmux
offers to pilot the terminal in ways previously thought impossible.

We've covered the [server](#server), [session](#sessions), [window](#windows),
and [pane](#panes) concepts. Panes are shells, AKA pseudoterminals or
PTYs. The command system. That [configuration](#config) is basically a file
filled with commands. An overview of the [target](#targets) system lets
you specify objects to interact with tmux commands. A breeze through [formats](#formats),
a template system with variables to retrieve information on tmux's current
state. How to [send keystrokes](#send-keys) and [copy from tmux panes](#capture-pane)
programmatically. A lot of [terminal tricks](#tips-and-tricks) that work across
platforms and well with tmux, including a [file watching workflow](#file-watching)
to run linting, testing, and build commands on file changes. [Two permissively licensed open source projects](#example-projects)
for demonstration. A [tmux configuration](https://www.github.com/tony/tmux-config)
you can copy and paste from. An object oriented [tmux API wrapper](https://libtmux.git-pull.com)
and a [tmux session manager](https://tmuxp.git-pull.com).
